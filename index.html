      <h3>c. Mark your availability in OTAS</h3>
      <p>
        Make sure to mark your availability to receive new inquiries, as the 1st
        thing in the morning in OTAS "my availability". You can mark your
        availability for new inquiries for the upcoming 24 hours. You must do
        this even for weekends, if you like to receive new leads.
      </p>

      <h3>d. Your Inquiry Day</h3>
      <p>
        According to your team, you may have an inquiry receiving day. Most
        teams at Olanka receive inquiries every other day. We do that because we
        want our tour consultants to keep a higher focus on the given inquiries.
      </p>

      <h3>e. Receiving Inquiry</h3>
      <p>
        As soon as the Olanka Web Chat team allocates an inquiry to you, few
        steps are going to happen automatically.

        NOTE: If any of the above steps are not happening correctly, you must
        communicate to your manager / sales operations department and get it
        corrected.
      </p>
      <h3>f. Inquiry Referral & My Leads</h3>
      <p>
        A referral happens when your existing customer or a lead passes you some
        other potential customer contacts, and you add them to the OTAS. "My
        Lead" refers to an inquiry when you find a potential customer by
        yourself without Olanka marketing support. The main difference between
        "My Leads" and "Referrals" is that referrals are referred by existing
        customers in OTAS, while "My Leads" are not.
      </p>
      <h3>g. Inquiry Re Allocation</h3>
      <p>
        If an inquiry has been allocated to someone mistakenly or if the sales
        process is violated by a tour consultant, an inquiry re-allocation can
        take place. In a re-allocation, you will be notified clearly by the
        sales operations department via WhatsApp or phone call.
      </p>
      <div class="border-box">
        <h4>Sales Process KPI</h4>
        <p>
          You're required to get in touch with the newly allocated customer
          within 10 minutes via Twilio Frontline App, either through a call or
          WhatsApp Business chat.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you are unable to meet this timeline, you need to update your
            sales notes in OTAS with valid reasons.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are unable to handle this customer at the current time, you
            need to contact the sales operations team and re-allocate this
            inquiry to another tour consultant.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sales Audit Factor</h4>
        <p>
          From the time the new inquiry is allocated to you, OTAS will start
          recording timers. OTAS will send notification emails if you fail to
          follow the steps. These notifications are CCed to your managers and
          are also tied to your performance reviews.

      <h3>h. Be the first!</h3>
      <p>
        At Olanka, we want to be the first company to get in touch with the
        customer to discuss their travel plans and provide the required travel
        quotes. Here's how we can achieve this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Customer first searches online for a tour provider. Olanka and a few
          other companies can appear in their search results.
        </li>
        <li>
          Customers typically visit multiple travel websites, engage with
          different companies, and compare quotes.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the help of Olanka's 24/7 web chat team, we can make an initial
          good impression on customers by engaging with them online and
          gathering their basic requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The key step lies in you, the "Tour Consultant," getting in touch with
          the customer quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          At Olanka, the tour consultant must contact the customer within 10
          minutes from the moment the customer engages with the Olanka Web Chat
          Team. The customer's initial communication can take place through web
          form submission or web chat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regardless of the method they initiate the conversation, the OTAS
          timer starts recording. Your KPI as a tour consultant is to contact
          the customer in less than 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Why within 10 minutes?</strong></li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            The customer is still online, making it an opportune time to discuss
            the detailed requirements of their tour plan. They are actively
            searching for tour companies at this moment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The customer is in the mindset of <strong> planning</strong> their
            upcoming tour, providing a genuine need and motivation for
            conversation.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li>
          In most cases, this will be the first time the customer encounters the
          "Olanka" brand name. Olanka is not yet globally recognized like
          Booking.com or Airbnb. Therefore, it is crucial to build
          <strong> “TRUST”</strong> in the brand name of Olanka by making a
          great first impression through the web chat team and the tour
          consultant. it is critical to build the <strong> “TRUST”</strong> an
          unknown brand name Olanka.

      <h1>Customer Requirement Gathering</h1>
      <p>
        Customer Requirement Gathering (RG) step is one of the most important
        steps in our sales process. We have a lot of emphasis on this step, so
        please pay attention to details here. For your easier understanding of
        RG, we have broken it down to 3 sections. Before, During & After the RG
        call.

              different questions at direct times. Ask all your questions in one

              It’s OK to do the RG using WhatsApp text messaging if the client
              is comfortable. However it will be super great if you can voice
              call the customer if possible. It will lead to a greater “Trust”
              building.
            </td>
            <td>
              DO NOT repeat the same questions which customers already answered
              to the Web Chat Team. But you can clarify, instead.

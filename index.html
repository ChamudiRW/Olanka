      <h3>c. Mark your availability in OTAS</h3>
      <p>
        Make sure to mark your availability to receive new inquiries, as the 1st
        thing in the morning in OTAS "my availability". You can mark your
        availability for new inquiries for the upcoming 24 hours. You must do
        this even for weekends, if you like to receive new leads.
      </p>

      <h3>d. Your Inquiry Day</h3>
      <p>
        According to your team, you may have an inquiry receiving day. Most
        teams at Olanka receive inquiries every other day. We do that because we
        want our tour consultants to keep a higher focus on the given inquiries.
      </p>

      <h3>e. Receiving Inquiry</h3>
      <p>
        As soon as the Olanka Web Chat team allocates an inquiry to you, few
        steps are going to happen automatically.

        NOTE: If any of the above steps are not happening correctly, you must
        communicate to your manager / sales operations department and get it
        corrected.
      </p>
      <h3>f. Inquiry Referral & My Leads</h3>
      <p>
        A referral happens when your existing customer or a lead passes you some
        other potential customer contacts, and you add them to the OTAS. "My
        Lead" refers to an inquiry when you find a potential customer by
        yourself without Olanka marketing support. The main difference between
        "My Leads" and "Referrals" is that referrals are referred by existing
        customers in OTAS, while "My Leads" are not.
      </p>
      <h3>g. Inquiry Re Allocation</h3>
      <p>
        If an inquiry has been allocated to someone mistakenly or if the sales
        process is violated by a tour consultant, an inquiry re-allocation can
        take place. In a re-allocation, you will be notified clearly by the
        sales operations department via WhatsApp or phone call.
      </p>
      <div class="border-box">
        <h4>Sales Process KPI</h4>
        <p>
          You're required to get in touch with the newly allocated customer
          within 10 minutes via Twilio Frontline App, either through a call or
          WhatsApp Business chat.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you are unable to meet this timeline, you need to update your
            sales notes in OTAS with valid reasons.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are unable to handle this customer at the current time, you
            need to contact the sales operations team and re-allocate this
            inquiry to another tour consultant.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sales Audit Factor</h4>
        <p>
          From the time the new inquiry is allocated to you, OTAS will start
          recording timers. OTAS will send notification emails if you fail to
          follow the steps. These notifications are CCed to your managers and
          are also tied to your performance reviews.
        </p>
        <p class="last-sentence">
          You will be issued a fine notice from OTAS and your sales incentives
          may be deducted accordingly if you fail to follow the process.

      <h3>h. Be the first!</h3>
      <p>
        At Olanka, we want to be the first company to get in touch with the
        customer to discuss their travel plans and provide the required travel
        quotes. Here's how we can achieve this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Customer first searches online for a tour provider. Olanka and a few
          other companies can appear in their search results.
        </li>
        <li>
          Customers typically visit multiple travel websites, engage with
          different companies, and compare quotes.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the help of Olanka's 24/7 web chat team, we can make an initial
          good impression on customers by engaging with them online and
          gathering their basic requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The key step lies in you, the "Tour Consultant," getting in touch with
          the customer quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          At Olanka, the tour consultant must contact the customer within 10
          minutes from the moment the customer engages with the Olanka Web Chat
          Team. The customer's initial communication can take place through web
          form submission or web chat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regardless of the method they initiate the conversation, the OTAS
          timer starts recording. Your KPI as a tour consultant is to contact
          the customer in less than 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Why within 10 minutes?</strong></li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            The customer is still online, making it an opportune time to discuss
            the detailed requirements of their tour plan. They are actively
            searching for tour companies at this moment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The customer is in the mindset of <strong> planning</strong> their
            upcoming tour, providing a genuine need and motivation for
            conversation.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li>
          In most cases, this will be the first time the customer encounters the
          "Olanka" brand name. Olanka is not yet globally recognized like
          Booking.com or Airbnb. Therefore, it is crucial to build
          <strong> “TRUST”</strong> in the brand name of Olanka by making a
          great first impression through the web chat team and the tour
          consultant. it is critical to build the <strong> “TRUST”</strong> an
          unknown brand name Olanka.

        RG, we have broken it down to 3 sections. Before, During & After the RG

      <h1>7. Customer Follow Up</h1>
      <h5>a. Follow up sequence</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          After sending the tour packages with options, you next important stage
          is follow up. Most sales people fail in follow up and loose the sale.
          You have to do the right amount of follow up at the right time, using
          the right “follow up” approach. You need be patience and not push the
          client too much.
        </li>
        <li>
          Follow up with your customer daily, unless they specifically given you
          a date/time to follow up.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 30 days of follow up if there is no positive response, mark the
          status of the lead as “Not Live” unless you want to keep the lead in
          the live funnel with a reason.
        </li>
        <li>Follow up till the customer says don’t call me!</li>
        <li>
          Customer follow up can be done using whatsApp text messages or calls
          by using Twilio Frontline App
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h5>b. Urgency</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A successful sale to happen you need to either create urgency or
          customer must have a natural urgency to book the trip. Example:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Natural Urgency - customer got leave approved to a certain period
              and he must travel during that period and that period is not too
              far so must book fast. In this instant you don't need to create
              any urgency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create Urgency - let's say if the customer has 12 more months for
              the travel date and they don't have urgency to make advance
              payment. In these cases you can create urgency by showing the
              customer that the rooms are getting filled and its good to book by
              paying 20%. Or you can use an air ticket price varying scenario to
              close the deal faster. If your creating urgency to the customer,
              make sure your client is accepting your urgency method. Else they
              might feel your trying to create unnecessary pressure.

              to move forward in the sales funnel. What you need to do, always
              ask the customer a date to follow up again. Eg. you can say “sir

            </td>
            <td>
              Don’t always ask for payment updates. Eg. “Sir is there any update

              the client which will be beneficial. Eg. Vidoes, Testimonials,
              Pictures, Offers, Excursion Details.

      <p>
        You can’t park your leads for more than 30 days maximum and you must
        clear the leads and have a healthy “Live” sales funnel. You are required
        to mark your leads as paid or you mark as NOT live, depending on the
        situation. Maximum you can keep your leads only 30 days in LIVE state
        unless the customer is requesting changes or on hold for payment with a
        specific timeline. OTAS will automatically question you to close off
        leads that have matured more than 30 days.
